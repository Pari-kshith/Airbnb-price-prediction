# Airbnb Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project involves predicting Airbnb rental prices by analyzing various listing features such as location, room type, capacity, amenities, and customer reviews using the Airbnb.csv dataset.  
A machine learning model (RandomForestRegressor) is trained to understand pricing patterns and generate accurate rental price predictions for new listings.

## Dataset Used
- **Dataset Name:** Airbnb.csv  
- **Source:** YBI Foundation  

## Tech Stack / Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Matplotlib  

## Project Workflow
1. Load and inspect the dataset  
2. Handle categorical variables using one-hot encoding  
3. Split dataset into training and testing sets  
4. Train the RandomForestRegressor model  
5. Predict rental prices  
6. Visualize original vs predicted prices  
7. Evaluate model performance  

## Model Used
**Random Forest Regressor**  
A machine-learning ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## Results
- Successfully trained a model to predict Airbnb rental prices  
- Visualized prediction accuracy using scatter plots  
- Achieved good performance with closely aligned actual vs predicted values
